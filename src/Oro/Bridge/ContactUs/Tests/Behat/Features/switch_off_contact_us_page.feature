Feature: Switch off contact us page
  As an Administrator
  I want be able to enable/disable ability of contacting Seller via Contact form on the website
  So that, we need to add on/off switcher (checkbox) for page with Contact Us form on the System level.

  Scenario: Disable contact us page on System level
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to System/ Configuration
    And I follow "Commerce/Customer/Contact Requests" on configuration sidebar
    And uncheck "Use default" for "Allow Contact Requests" field
    And I fill form with:
      | Allow Contact Requests | false |
    And I click "Save settings"
    When I am on the homepage
    Then I should not see "Contact Us"
    And I go to "/contact-us"
    Then I should see "404 Not Found"
