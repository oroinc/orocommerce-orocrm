# OroCustomerAccountBridgeBundle

OroCustomerAccountBridgeBundle ensures the coordinated work of OroCommerce and OroCRM packages, provides installation migrations to create Accounts for OroCommerce [Customers](https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/SaleBundle) and therefore allows admin users to keep a 360-degree view of Account > Customer > Customer User relationship in the OroCommerce application.
