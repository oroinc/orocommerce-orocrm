# OroSaleActivityContactBridgeBundle

OroSaleActivityContactBridgeBundle helps treat the "Requests for more information" action in the management console as [contact activity](https://github.com/oroinc/crm/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ActivityContactBundle). This action is accounted for in all contact-related statistics.

> Admin users in the management console can request more information from the [Request For Quote](https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/RFPBundle) view page.
